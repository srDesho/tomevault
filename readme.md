## 🔑 User Roles

- **USER:** Manage own book collection and reading counts
- **ADMIN:** Manage all users and collections
- **SUPER_ADMIN:** Full system access

## 🎯 Why I Built This

TomeVault started as a personal project to showcase my skills as a Full Stack developer, with focus on backend development using Java and Spring Boot. I wanted a simple way to track my reading progress and see which books I've read multiple times.

## 🔨 Building from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/srDesho/tomevault.git

# Backend
cd tomevault-api
mvn clean package
java -jar target/tomevault-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Frontend
cd ../tomevault-web
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

**Note:** The live application is automatically deployed from GitHub:
- **Render** watches the `main` branch for backend changes
- **Netlify** watches the `main` branch for frontend changes
- Any push to `main` triggers automatic deployment

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a **reading tracker**, not a reading app
- Book information (title, author, cover) is retrieved from Google Books API
- The read counter tracks how many times you've finished a book
- No actual book content is stored or displayed

## 🔮 What's Next

Currently working on:

- Email verification for user registration to enhance account security
- Manual book addition for books not available in Google Books API
